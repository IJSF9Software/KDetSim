\chapter{Introduction}

The state of the art TCAD tools for simulation of semiconductor device properties 
are vital for successful device development and process simulation at different 
semiconductor detector processing/designing facilities. They are commercialy developed
for markets of which high energy physics community is not the most important part. On the other 
hand the requirements for high energy physics application of these tools are in a sense 
unique and not so well covered. 

Application of semiconductor detectors in high radiation 
fields invevitably leads to different levels of radiation damage. Althogh many efforts have
been spent in the past to simulate the effects of deep traps to detector operation, 
at present we don't know the set of traps that would entirely reproduce the changes in 
device operation properties, such as electric field profile, charge collection efficiency and leakage 
current. A single trap is defined by 6 parameters (electron,hole capture cross-sections, energy level, concentration and type). If   simple SRH statistics only  

TCAD tools are also not well suited for Monte Carlo simulation, bread and butter of 
high energy physics simulations. They are ofter required for e.g. detection efficiency studies, position resolution etc. Although with some effort one can generate different initial 
charge distribution deposited by ionizing particle or light pulse, it is very demanding to simulate 
large multi-electrode structure.
